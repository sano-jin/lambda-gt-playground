![examples of graphs](docs/graphs-image.svg)

Graphs are a generalized concept that encompasses more complex data structures than trees,
such as difference lists, doubly-linked lists, skip lists, and leaf-linked trees.
Normally, these structures are handled with destructive assignments to heaps,
as opposed to a purely functional programming style.

We propose a new purely functional language, λGT,
that handles graphs as immutable, first-class data structures with
a pattern matching mechanism based on Graph Transformation.

We implemented a reference interpreter, a reference implementation of the language.
We believe this is usable for further investigation, including in the design of real languages based on λGT.
The interpreter is written in only 500 lines of OCaml code.

We also have [a visualizing tool that runs on a browser](https://sano-jin.github.io/lambda-gt-online/).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [opam](https://opam.ocaml.org/)

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sano-jin/lambda-gt-alpha.git
cd lambda-gt-alpha
opam install .
dune build
```

## Usage

```bash
./run example/dlist.lgt
```

which will result in `{_Y >< _X}`.

See [/example](example) for more examples.

## Syntax

```
Expression     e ::= { T }                                  // Graph
                  |  e1 e2                                  // Application
                  |  case e1 of e2 -> e3 | otherwise -> e4  // Case Expression

Graph Template T ::= v (_X1, ..., _Xn)                      // Atom
                  |  _X >< _Y                               // Fusion
                  |  x[_X1, ..., _Xn]                      // Graph Context
                  |  (T, T)                                 // Molecule
                  |  nu _X. T                               // Link Creation

Atom Name      v ::= Constr                                 // Constructor Name
                  |  <\x[_X1, ..., _Xn]. e>                 // Lambda Abstraction
```

For the syntax and semantics, please see
[the paper[1]](http://jssst.or.jp/files/user/taikai/2022/papers/20-L.pdf).

- We have enabled logging.

  ```ocaml
  {Log} exp
  ```

  evaluates `exp`, prints the value, and results in the value.

## Development

![dependency graph](docs/dependency.svg)

Please give me issues or pull requests if you find any bugs or solutions for them.

We aim to build the simplest implementation.
Thus, we may not accept a request for an enhancement.
However, we appreciate it because it will be helpful in the design and implementation
of the _real_ language based on this POC.

### Testing

```bash
dune runtest
```

See [test/test.ml](test/test.ml) for more information.

- Configure tests with the file.

     trees and require non-trivial formalism, the implementation of the language is also more complicated than
     ordinary functional languages. λGT is even more advanced than the ordinary graph transformation systems.

     Graphs are a generalized concept that encompasses more complex data structures than trees,
     such as difference lists, doubly-linked lists, skip lists, and leaf-linked trees.
     Normally, these structures are handled with destructive assignments to heaps,
     which is opposed to a purely functional programming style and makes verification difficult.
     We propose a new
     purely functional language, \\(\lambda_{GT}\\), that handles graphs as immutable,
     first-class data structures with a pattern matching mechanism
     based on Graph Transformation and developed a new type system, \\(F_{GT}\\), for the language.
     Our approach is in contrast with the analysis of pointer manipulation programs
     using separation logic, shape analysis, etc. in that
     (i) we do not consider destructive operations
     but pattern matchings over graphs provided by the new higher-level language that
     abstract pointers and heaps away and that
     (ii) we pursue what properties can be established automatically using a rather simple typing framework.
